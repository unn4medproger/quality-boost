# Quality Boost
CS:S Trikz Macro for insecure servers made as [client plugin](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Client_plugins)

# Installation
Place `macro.dll` inside `cstrike` folder.

# Usage
Add `-insecure` to the game launch parameters.  
Enter `plugin_load macro` in the console while being in the main menu **OR** add `+plugin_load macro` to the game launch parameters.  
Activate by pressing right mouse button (`+attack2`) while holding flashbang. 


To change the delay write `macro` and value, e.g. `macro 0.08`. Default is 0.1.


Result timing with 0.1 delay is almost always perfect. Tested with 300 fps and stable internet connection.


You can swap `+attack` and `+attack2` while holding flashbang by typing `macro_swap` in console. You can add `+macro_swap` to the game launch parameters to enable swap on launch.
