# Quality Boost
CS:S Trikz Macro for insecure servers made as [client plugin](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Client_plugins)

# Installation
Place **macro.dll** inside **cstrike** folder.

# Usage
Add **-insecure** to the game launch parameters.  
Enter **plugin_load macro** in the console being in the main menu.  
Activate by pressing MOUSE2 button (+attack2) while holding flashbang. 


To change the delay write **macro** and value, e.g. **macro 0.08**. Default is 0.1.


Result timing with 0.1 delay is almost always perfect. Tested with 300 fps and stable internet connection.


You can swap **+attack** and **+attack2** while holding flashbang by typing **macro_swap**.
